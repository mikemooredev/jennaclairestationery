    Briony and James got married at Oakham School Chapel, followed by a
    reception at Buckminster Barns, in October 2017. The lovely couple wanted
    their stationery to have a romantic light and airy feel with their colour
    scheme of pretty soft pinks, creams, a touch of greenery and gold. I worked
    on a bespoke floral design including roses, peonies and eucalyputus, and
    packaged their invitations with a vellum paper wrap and gold ribbon. Their
    on the day stationery then incorporated elements of the floral design across
    the table plan, table names, menus and name tags.
