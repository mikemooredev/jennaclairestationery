    Louise and Anthony got married at the stunningly beautiful Dorfold Hall in
    Cheshire, in May 2019. The bride just so happens to be one of my best
    friends so being asked to create something special for their wedding was an
    honour. She has a slight obsession with gold and wanted to get this colour
    into every aspect of their wedding so, along with getting to draw their
    wonderful venue, I got to work designing something special. Roses were also
    something that the couple wanted to incorporate due to the grooms surname,
    and eventually the brides, surname being ‘Rose”. I worked on a small hand
    painted bespoke rose floral design to incorporate into their stationery.
    Their on the day stationery then incorporated the venue drawing and rose
    design, as well as lots of gold!
