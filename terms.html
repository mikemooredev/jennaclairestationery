    PROOFS<br />
    It is important that proofs are carefully checked over before proceeding to
    print. You are responsible for the proof reading of all digital PDF proofs
    sent to you and printing will not commence until you have confirmed you are
    happy to proceed. You will be liable for the cost of re-printing due to any
    errors discovered after printing that appear on the proofs. You will be able
    to make 2 lots of changes to your design. Any further revisions will be
    charged at £30 per revision.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center">
    Please note: Although all products displayed are as accurate as possible for
    colour, the colour you see will depend on your screen and printed colours
    will always differ very slightly to that of a computer screen. In most cases
    a sample can be sent beforehand.<br /><br />
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center">
    TIMEFRAMES<br />
    The timeframe of your order can take anything between 2 to 8 weeks depending
    on the level of customisation required to your stationery, the amount of
    revisions required and your response times to proofs that are sent. It is
    important to consider that design revisions and/or delays in feedback may
    affect the timeline and potentially delay your order.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center">
    Once I have all the required information from you and have receipt of the
    deposit, I will get started on your designs. An electronic proof of your
    design will be sent over to you. Once you have given the final approval to
    print and final payment has been received, your stationery will be printed
    and dispatched.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center">
    I always endeavour to complete orders as quickly as possible but will never
    compromise on the love and care they deserve. On the rare occasion that I
    require to extend these dates, you will be notified immediately.<br /><br />
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center">
    PAYMENT<br />
    Before any design work commences a 50% deposit will be required. The
    remaining payment is due on final approval prior to printing.<br /><br />
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center">
    PUBLICATION<br />
    Any images of work designed by Jenna Claire Stationery must be correctly
    credited.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center">
    Your invitations/wedding goods may be posted on the website and social
    media. Please advise beforehand if you do not wish your stationery to
    feature.<br /><br />
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center">
    CANCELLATIONS &amp; REFUNDS<br />
    Due to the nature of the product all stationery orders will not be eligible
    for cancellation or refunds. Once you have provided your final approval of
    the proofs, returns will not be accepted due to errors on your part. Should
    a mistake be made on my part, your order will be reprinted.<br /><br />
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center">
    DELIVERY<br />
    Small orders under the value of £20, and proofs, will be sent first class
    via royal mail. All larger stationery order will be sent tracked via either
    royal mail or parcel force. International orders will be sent tracked via
    parcel force. I am unable to guarentee any timeframes regarding shipment and
    equally do not held liable for losses, damages or delays due to shipping.<br /><br />
