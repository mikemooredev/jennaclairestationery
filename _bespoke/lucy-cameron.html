    Lucy and Cameron got married at Wilderness Reserve, Suffolk in July 2017,
    with a weekend full of activities and celebrations. They came to me with
    lots of ideas that they wanted to incorporate into their wedding stationery.
    Their brief was clean, fresh, charming, elegant, and sophisticated
    invitations, but to include an element of fun. They wanted to somehow
    incorporate penguins and vegetables, with a colour scheme of gold, herby
    greens and creams. After a skype call between myself and the bride, who
    lives in New York, it was my job to design and deliver the vision. Who would
    have thought you would see penguins walking through a vegetable patch? The
    bespoke motif was used throughout their invitations and on the day
    stationery, and was even made into a rubber stamp and used for a snap chat
    filter!
