    Vicky and Simon got married in Manchester at the Radisson Blu Edwardian in
    November 2015. They wanted to go for a woodland theme. I translated this in
    kraft printed invitations paired with hand drawn woodland animals and
    finished with a rafia tie to hold all the elements together. This gave the
    rustic feel they were after to contrast the modern clean feel of the venue.
    Each table on their wedding day were named after different woodland animals
    and were decorated with pieces of tree trunks and pine cones to bring to
    life the woodland feel.
