    I’m Jenna Claire, a creative and passionate designer with a love for
    stationery. <br />And then suddenly, you meet the one that makes you forget
    about yesterday, and dream about tomorrow.

  <p>
    For me love is one of life’s greatest feelings and the idea of being
    involved with couples during such a special time in their lives prompted the
    creation of my brand.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center">
    Jenna Claire is a brand designing beautiful stationery and paper goods for
    all occasions.<br />
    I love to create unique and personal designs that reflect just what your
    wedding day is all about. Whether you have your own vision, or just need a
    little guidance, together we can<br />
    create the perfect collection that can be enjoyed, shared and treasured for
    years to come.

    Most paper products are printed in house and hand crafted with the love they
    deserve!
